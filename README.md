### Overview
Our team, consisting of four members — Kirill Krinkin, Iaroslav Chelombitko, Ilia Nechaev, and Kamaliia Alisheva — forms the UI/UX/AI Tests team. Our primary goal is to ensure that the generated code meets the necessary standards for usability and approval.

###  Problem Statement (technology perspective)
The problem we are to solve is to develop a system that will take as an input the directory with the code and tests it.

### Objectives
- Test the code in case of any unused entities in it
- Test the typing of the code
- Ilia tests...
- Approval

### Features
- Unused Code Checks: We employ various established methods to verify whether the code contains unused elements and ensure adequate typing. For the code to progress, it must pass all tests without any failures or "errors." These tests are conducted using a combination of tools.
